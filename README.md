To start, run Setup_Generator.py

This project aims to create a interface that can help Satisfactory players achieve Optimal Satisfaction by giving them a detailed list of ways to produce any resource in the game
Detailed information about each path can be viewed by double clicking their title in the generated listbox after the paths are calculated

Not all resources are currently supported

Be careful when using the 'All Recipes' option as it can, on some recipes, try to calculate billions of possible production paths
