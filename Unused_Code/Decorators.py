	Methods of determining load proportion:
	  1) Total recipes - recipes_completed / total_recipes 
	  		  -  needs to know total number of recipes from start
			  -  recipes_completed needs to be reset at the end of the recursion loop
	
	  2) Proportional completion - sum of (parent_proportion / iterations) at lowest depth for each recursive path 
	  		  -  needs to keep track of parent proportion (progress proportion of parent recipe for the current recipe)
	  		  -  needs to know which recipes on a branch are the lowest
			  -  proportion adding is based on branches finished rather than based on total recipes
		
	  3) Random Counter - proportion is the max of (1, 1 / random_n + proportion)
	  		  -  doesn't actually show the real proportion of completed values
			  -  only serves to give the user the idea that the computer is doing something
